This usually means avoiding tight spaces or areas that are difficult to navigate.\n\nBased on the initial analysis of the distances to the parking areas:\n\n1. Parking Area 1: Distance ≈ 0.275\n2. Parking Area 4: Distance ≈ 0.277\n3. Parking Area 3: Distance ≈ 0.291\n4. Parking Area 5: Distance ≈ 0.335\n5. Parking Area 2: Distance ≈ 0.357\n\nGiven this, Parking Area 1 is the closest and likely the most convenient for passengers unless it has obstacles or is particularly difficult to access. If Parking Area 1 has obstacles or accessibility issues, Parking Area 4 would be the next best option as it is also very close and should be relatively easy to access. \n\nPlease provide the coordinates of any obstacles if you need a more precise recommendation considering them."

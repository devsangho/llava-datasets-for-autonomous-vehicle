Parking area 2:\n   - Center: ((-0.110000 + -0.258000 + -0.358000 + -0.208000) / 4, (0.002000 + 0.206000 + 0.134000 + -0.070000) / 4)\n   - Center: (-0.233500, 0.068000)\n\nNow, we calculate the distance from the car's position (0, 0) to each center using the distance formula:\n[ \text{Distance} = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} ]\n\n1. Distance to parking area 1 center:\n   - Distance: (sqrt{(0.158500 - 0)^2 + (-0.317000 - 0)^2})\n   - Distance: (sqrt{0.02514025 + 0.100489})\n   - Distance: (sqrt{0.12562925} approx 0.3545)\n\n2. Distance to parking area 2 center:\n   - Distance: (sqrt{(-0.233500 - 0)^2 + (0.068000 - 0)^2})\n   - Distance: (sqrt{0.05452225 + 0.004624})\n   - Distance: (sqrt{0.05914625} approx 0.2432)\n\nThe closest parking area is parking area 2, with a center at (-0.233500, 0.068000), and a distance of approximately 0.2432 units from the car's position. Therefore, parking area 2 is the fastest to park in."

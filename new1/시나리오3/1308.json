Parking Area 1 center: [(-0.2215, 0.3415)]\n   Distance: √((-0.2215)^2 + (0.3415)^2) ≈ 0.406\n\n2. Parking Area 2 center: [(-0.2375, 0.154)]\n   Distance: √((-0.2375)^2 + (0.154)^2) ≈ 0.282\n\n3. Parking Area 3 center: [(-0.302, -0.021)]\n   Distance: √((-0.302)^2 + (-0.021)^2) ≈ 0.303\n\nThe closest parking area to (0, 0) is Parking Area 2. Therefore, you should park in Parking Area 2 for the fastest parking."

This might mean choosing a spot that is less congested or provides a more straightforward path to the destination. Based on the coordinates provided and without specific information about obstacles or additional context, we can infer that:\n\n1. Parking Area 1 is slightly farther but offers a more elevated position.\n2. Parking Area 2 is closest, which usually means less walking distance for passengers.\n3. Parking Area 3 is lower but not significantly further than Area 2.\n\nGiven these considerations, Parking Area 2 remains the best recommendation due to its proximity to the starting point (0, 0), minimizing the distance passengers need to walk. This reduces the overall effort and time for both the driver and passengers to reach their destination."

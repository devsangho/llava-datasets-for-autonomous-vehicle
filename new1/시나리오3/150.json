Centroid: (-0.2125, 0.2785), Distance to origin: √((-0.2125)² + 0.2785²) ≈ 0.351\n7. Centroid: (-0.2060, 0.0925), Distance to origin: √((-0.2060)² + 0.0925)² ≈ 0.227\n8.

Centroid: (-0.2925, -0.2770), Distance to origin: √((-0.2925)² + (-0.2770)²) ≈ 0.403\n\nBased on these distances, I recommend parking in the third area [(0.058, -0.014), (0.132, -0.112), (0.336, 0.040), (0.266, 0.140)] since it has the smallest distance to the origin, making it the most convenient for passengers."

This can be done by calculating the distance from (0, 0) to the center of each parking area. The center of a parking area (square) can be calculated as the average of its four coordinates.\n\n1. Center of Parking Area 1:\n   \u200b(0.351500, 0.117000)\n\n2. Center of Parking Area 2:\n   \u200b(0.221000, 0.278000)\n\n3. Center of Parking Area 3:\n   \u200b(-0.185000, 0.315000)\n\n4. Center of Parking Area 4:\n   \u200b(-0.347000, 0.182000)\n\nNext, we calculate the Euclidean distance from (0, 0) to each center:\n\n1. Distance to Parking Area 1:\n   \u200b0.369\n\n2. Distance to Parking Area 2:\n   \u200b0.355\n\n3. Distance to Parking Area 3:\n   \u200b0.365\n\n4. Distance to Parking Area 4:\n   \u200b0.391\n\nThe closest parking area is Parking Area 2, with a distance of approximately 0.355 from the car's initial position. Thus, you should park in Parking Area 2 for the fastest parking."

Typically, you would want a parking spot that is closer to the destination and has easy access for passengers to enter and exit the vehicle. Given the initial position of the car at (0, 0), and without knowing the exact destination, we can prioritize the closest parking spot for convenience.\n\nBased on the previous calculations, Parking Area 2 is the closest to the car's initial position. This would generally be the most convenient for passengers as well.\n\nTherefore, I recommend Parking Area 2 for the convenience of passengers."

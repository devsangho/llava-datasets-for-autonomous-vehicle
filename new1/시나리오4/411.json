Given that the specific destination is not provided, the best choice would be the parking area closest to the origin (0,0), while also ensuring it provides convenient passenger access. \n\nHere are the distances to each parking area's center for reference:\n\n1. Parking Area 1 Center:\n   - Center: (0.1405, 0.2380)\n   - Distance from (0, 0): √(0.1405² + 0.2380²) ≈ 0.276\n\n2.

However, since Parking Area 1 is almost as close and is positioned in the positive quadrant where walking may be more straightforward (assuming typical layouts where more facilities are located in the positive quadrant), it might be more convenient for passengers.\n\nTherefore, considering passenger convenience, I would recommend Parking Area 1."

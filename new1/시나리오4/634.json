Distance to Parking Area 1: sqrt((0.2425)^2 + (0.085)^2) ≈ 0.258\n2. Distance to Parking Area 2: sqrt((0.318)^2 + (-0.015)^2) ≈ 0.318\n3. Distance to Parking Area 3: sqrt((-0.126)^2 + (-0.322)^2) ≈ 0.347\n4. Distance to Parking Area 4: sqrt((-0.202)^2 + (-0.222)^2) ≈ 0.302\n5. Distance to Parking Area 5: sqrt((-0.3525)^2 + (-0.0235)^2) ≈ 0.353\n\nThe closest parking area is Parking Area 1 with a distance of approximately 0.258.\n\nTherefore, to park the fastest, you should park in Parking Area 1."

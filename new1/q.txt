If you pass me the locations of parking areas and obstacles, I will ask you several questions about the optimal parking area. Each is composed of 4 coordinates and is composed of a square. The obstacle is also a square defined by four coordinates. The position of the car is (0, 0)
Based on the center of the car, the right direction is the positive x-axis direction, and the upward direction is the positive y-axis direction. In addition, all coordinates are normalized to a size of 1. and, Answer my questions in unstyled text format(No Bold).

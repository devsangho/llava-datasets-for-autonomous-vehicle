      "value": "To determine the optimal parking spot considering the obstacles, we need to check if any parking slots intersect with the obstacle. If they do, those slots should be avoided.\n\nThe coordinates of the obstacle are:\n1. Obstacle 1:\n   - (0.020000, 0.320000)\n   - (-0.072000, 0.320000)\n   - (-0.084000, 0.492000)\n   - (0.012000, 0.492000)\n\nTo simplify, let's use a basic check to see if any part of the parking slots overlaps with the obstacle. For this purpose, we will check if the obstacle's bounding box intersects with any parking slot's bounding box.\n\nThe bounding box of the obstacle:\n- X range: [-0.084000, 0.020000]\n- Y range: [0.320000, 0.492000]\n\nBounding boxes of the parking slots:\n1. Slot 1:\n   - X range: [0.078000, 0.344000]\n   - Y range: [0.166000, 0.328000]\n2. Slot 2:\n   - X range: [0.054000, 0.320000]\n   - Y range: [0.278000, 0.438000]\n3. Slot 3:\n   - X range: [-0.448000, -0.180000]\n   - Y range: [-0.060000, 0.104000]\n4. Slot 4:\n   - X range: [-0.468000, -0.204000]\n   - Y range: [0.054000, 0.216000]\n\nLet's check for intersection:\n1. Slot 1 X range [0.078000, 0.344000] does not intersect with [-0.084000, 0.020000]\n2. Slot 2 X range [0.054000, 0.320000] partially intersects with [-0.084000, 0.020000] but Y range [0.278000, 0.438000] intersects with [0.320000, 0.492000]\n3. Slot 3 X range [-0.448000, -0.180000] does not intersect with [-0.084000, 0.020000]\n4. Slot 4 X range [-0.468000, -0.204000] does not intersect with [-0.084000, 0.020000]\n\nBased on this analysis, Slot 2 intersects with the obstacle and should be avoided.\n\nAmong the remaining slots (1, 3, and 4), Slot 3 has the closest distance to the origin without intersecting with the obstacle.\n\nTherefore, considering the obstacle, I recommend parking in Slot 3."

      "value": "If there are passengers, it's usually preferable to park closer to the destination to minimize the walking distance. Considering the obstacle and the distances from the origin as calculated earlier:\n\n1. Slot 1 Center Distance: 0.324\n2. Slot 2 Center Distance: 0.405 (intersects with obstacle, avoid)\n3. Slot 3 Center Distance: 0.314\n4. Slot 4 Center Distance: 0.362\n\nSince Slot 2 is not an option due to the obstacle, we compare the remaining slots. Slot 3 is the closest to the origin with a distance of 0.314. \n\nHowever, for passenger convenience, let's also consider the proximity of the slots in terms of ease of access and space availability. Slot 1, although slightly farther from the origin than Slot 3, has a more central location in the provided coordinates and might offer easier access depending on the specific layout and entry points.\n\nTaking everything into account, especially passenger convenience and obstacle avoidance:\n\nI recommend parking in Slot 1 if ease of access and a more central location are prioritized. If distance to the origin is the primary concern, Slot 3 is still the best option."
